# Google Hashcode Online Qualification

Hash Code is a yearly team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. 
The problems are always engineering related and you need optimization methods to solve them. 

The structure in this repo is chaotic on purpose. 
Due to the time limit in the competition our team focuses on rapid prototyping and fast code iteration.
We try to solve the problem in the most simple way possible and then iterate and improve the solution in the time we have left.
